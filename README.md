This is an Esperanto Flash Card App

The game pulls 10 random English words from a JSON file and present them one at a time while the user types in the appropriate Esperanto cognate for each word. The score is kept and 8 out of 10 correct is considered a winning condition.

The JSON file that is used for the word list is kept at myjson.com.

The Time Priority Matrix is located on the project-worksheet.md file.

MVP

The app keeps track of the score for the player and would indicate when the player wins the game. When the game is complete, the user has the option to play again. 


Post MVP

Eventually there would be a list of about 500-1000 words to draw from.

Have logic where the player would not be able to move on to new words until they got at least 8 out of the 10 words correct. 

Incorporate a timer on the game page. 

The app shows the player’s cumulative score. 

When complete, the user would have the option to play again and the app keeps track of the player’s cumulative score for the entire session. 

There would be a way for the player to exit to a page that describes the basic grammar of the language

Esperanto is an artificial language that was created in 1887. It was specifically constructed to be used as a second language and it is proven to be much easier to learn than natural languages due to its phonetic spelling, completely regular grammar, and intuitive rules governing word formation. There are hundreds of thousands of Esperanto speakers living on all six populated continents of the world, connected only by their willingness to extend 'a linguistic handshake' to the diverse group known as the Esperantujo.
