# seir-1118-project-1
My first project for the seir 1118 class

This is an Esperanto Flash Card App

The game pulls 10 random English words from a JSON file and present them one at a time while the user types in the appropriate Esperanto cognate for each word. Score is kept and 8 out of 10 correct is considered a winning condition.

Esperanto is an artificial language that was created in 1887. It was specifically constructed to be used as a second language and it is proven to be much easier to learn than natural languages due to its phonetic spelling, its completely regular grammar, and its intuitive rules governing word formation. There are hundreds of thousands of Esperanto speakers living in all the populated areas of the world, connected only by their willingness to extend 'a linguistic handshake' to the diverse group known as the Esperantujo.
